#### I will create a Python function that returns the energy from input masses for the mass energy equivalence. Here, I aslo make plots for a line, quadratic, cubic, and an exponential function. I used linspace to create 20 input values that range from 1 to 5. In this way all four plotted lines are visible and can be compared to each other.  If I were to plot the equations with an array as the input values and have them extend from 0 to 20, then the exponential will overpower the linear, quadratic, and cubic.
